# Official documentation

More information for this sample - and for how to get started with Microsoft Teams development in general - is found in [Get started on the Microsoft Teams platform with Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-nodejs).

# Using this sample locally

This sample can be run locally using `ngrok` as described in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-nodejs), but you'll need to set up some environment variables. There are many ways to do this, but the easiest, if you are using Visual Studio Code, is to add a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations):

```json
[...]
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch - Teams Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/src/app.js",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
            "env": {
                "BASE_URI": "https://########.ngrok.io",
                "MICROSOFT_APP_ID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                "MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD": "yourBotAppPassword",
                "NODE_DEBUG": "botbuilder",
                "SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING": "y",
                "NODE_CONFIG_DIR": "../config"
            }
[...]
```

Where:

* `########` matches your actual ngrok URL
* `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` is the ID and password, respectively, for your bot
* `NODE_DEBUG` will show you what's happening in your bot in the Visual Studio Code debug console
* `NODE_CONFIG_DIR` points to the directory at the root of the repository (by default, when the app is run locally, it looks for it in the `src` folder)

# Deploying to Azure App Service

## Visual Studio Code extensions

The easiest way to deploy to Azure is to use Visual Studio Code with Azure extensions. There are many extensions for Azure - you can get all of them at once by installing the [Node Pack for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) or you can install just the [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extension.

## Creating a new Node.js web app

Once you've installed the extensions, you'll see a new Azure icon on the left in Visual Studio Code. Click on the + icon to create a new web app. Once you've created your web app:

1. Add the following Application Settings (environment variables):

   ```
   MICROSOFT_APP_ID=<YOUR BOT'S APP ID>
   MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=<YOUR BOT'S APP PASSWORD>
   WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=8.9.4
   ```
   
1. Configure the Deployment Source for your app (either your local copy of this repository or one you've forked on GitHub).
1. Deploy your web app. Visual Studio Code will tell you when you are done.

## Deploying to Azure for Node.js on Windows

Since this repo was optimized for Azure App Service, which runs on Linux, the `.deployment` file references `bash deploy.sh`. There's also a `deploy.cmd` if you want to deploy to Azure running Node.js on Windows. If you do, change `.deployment` to this instead:

```
[config]
command = deploy.cmd
```
